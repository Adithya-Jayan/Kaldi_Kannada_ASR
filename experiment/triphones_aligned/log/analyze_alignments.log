The optional-silence phone sil occupies 32.3% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 72.5% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 6.7% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 7.6 hours of data, or 5.2 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 2.9% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (20,21.4,47)
